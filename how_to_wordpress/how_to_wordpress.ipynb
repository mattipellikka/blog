It's a great tool for prototyping all sorts of algorithms in the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) environment, while it also does a fantastic job in taking up notes on the mathematics behind those algorithms, thanks to Markdown and the beautiful MathML formatting of mathematical formulas in Latex syntax.\n",
