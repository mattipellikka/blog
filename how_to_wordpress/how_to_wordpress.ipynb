It's a great tool for prototyping all sorts of algorithms in the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) environment, while it also does fantastic job in taking up notes on the mathematics behind those algorithms thanks to Markdown and the beautiful formatting of mathematical formulas using the Latex syntax.\n",
